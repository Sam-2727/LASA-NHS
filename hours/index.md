NHS members are required to receive 15 hours per semester, of which at least 10 must be sponsored hours, or 30 unsponsored hours in total.

The due date for logging these hours is the beginning of the second semester. Please enter your hours in the below form. Only one event can be logged at a time. We recommend you log an event as soon as it occurs.

Sponsored volunteering activites, once approved, are listed [here](/hours/opportunities).

NHS recommends that, in order to keep track of the amount of hours you have, you make a copy of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaZgjdMwjMNDO_uYv0FlWRVh5j4s1i1KXdnX7E0yZ0g/edit?usp=sharing).

There is a "three strike" system for service hours. If a member fails to meet service requirements for a semester, they will receive one strike. Strikes can also be received for failing to attend an NHS meeting without proper notification. Upon receiving three strikes, your membership in NHS will be reviewed.

**If your club wants to have your volunteering opportunities count as sponsored hours,** please fill out [this form](/
