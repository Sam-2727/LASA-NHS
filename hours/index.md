NHS members are required to receive XYZ hours per semester, of which at least XYZ must be sponsored hours.

The due date for logging these hours is December XY. Please enter your hours in the below form (you can enter them all at once or separately throughout the year).

There is a "three strike" system for service hours. If a member fails to meet service requirements for a semester, they will receive one strike. Strikes can also be received for failing to attend an NHS meeting without proper notification. Upon receiving three strikes, your membership in NHS will be reviewed.
