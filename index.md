National Honor Society is a nationwide service organization, with school specific chapters in many high schools. Sophomores and Juniors are inducted into National Honor Society at the end of each year if they meet certain academic and extracurricular requirements.

NHS officers run LASA's national honor society, ensuring that all members meet the service requirements, organizing sponsored volunteering hours, maintaining an informative website for LASA NHS, and inducting new members into NHS.
