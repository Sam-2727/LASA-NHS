NHS officers run LASA’s national honor society, ensuring that all members meet the service requirements, organizing sponsored volunteering hours, maintaining an informative website for LASA NHS, and inducting new members into NHS.

You can contact us at anytime at <contact@lasanhs.org>. The teacher sponsor for NHS is Mr. Loewenstern, who can be contacted at <neil.loewenstern@austinisd.org>.

**Elections for NHS Officers are held at the end of every year**

# President: Jasmine Gokingco
Hi! I’m Jasmine. I’m Consul (Co-President) of LASA’s Latin Club, a member of Bowls of Hope, and secretary of LASA Cares. I play for LASA’s JV Volleyball team and I am Captain of LASA’s Advanced Certamen (Latin Quizbowl) team. In my spare time, I love songwriting, playing guitar, and showcasing my awesome Mickey Mouse Impression.

# Vice-President: Lois Lee
My name is Lois Lee, and I am really looking forward to serving as vice president this school year. My favorite way of giving back to the community is helping and tutoring kids, but other types of volunteer work have also always been very humbling experiences too. Besides volunteering with kids, I enjoy playing the piano, violin, and tennis, as well as painting.

# Service Board Chairs
## Shruthi Aravindan
My name is Shruthi, and I am your Service Board Co-Chair for 2020-2021! I'm so excited to provide opportunities for my fellow NHS members to actively engage in their communities, even if it has to be virtual. Through service projects, I hope to blend community service with career exploration and other things NHS members are interested in. During my time as an NHS officer, I hope to create changes and institute initiatives that continue beyond my time at LASA, and after we move to the new campus. As the founder of an international non-profit, Vitality Volunteers, I’ve restructured my organization to help virtually during the pandemic. Using my experience, I will provide opportunities for LASA students to engage in community service that best reflects the interests of our student body. Outside of my experiences in community service, I play the violin and piano (fun fact my name means music), and I've recently taken up photography as a hobby.

## Mia Ternus
Hi, I'm Mia and I'm a senior at LASA. You may recognize me through orchestra, cross country, or Fire Academy. I'm also involved in several clubs here at LASA, and I'm an officer of Bechdel Movie Club. I love running, hiking, and swimming, and it wouldn't be hard to spot me at Zilker or on Town Lake. I have a 15 year old chihuahua named Sophie who loves to accompany me when she can, and loves pepperoni. I'm excited to be service board chair for this chapter of NHS, and I'm very optimistic about how this year is going to turn out!
